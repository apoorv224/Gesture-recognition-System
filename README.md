# Gesture-recognition-System
Machine Learning Project
Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a gesture recognition system capable of understanding and interpreting hand gestures as trained by the user. The system leverages machine learning techniques to accurately recognize and classify different hand gestures, facilitating interaction with digital devices in an intuitive and natural manner.

Project Working
Data Collection:

Capture Gestures: Using a webcam, capture images or video frames of various hand gestures. Each gesture is labeled with its corresponding class.
Preprocessing: Convert images to a suitable format, apply image augmentation techniques, and normalize the data to improve model performance.
Feature Extraction:

Mediapipe Holistic Model: Utilize Mediapipe's Holistic model to detect and extract landmarks of hands, face, and pose. This provides a comprehensive set of features representing each gesture.
Model Training:

Dataset Creation: Compile a dataset of extracted landmarks and corresponding labels.
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Experiment with different classifiers such as SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes.
Training: Train each model on the training set and fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Accuracy and Confusion Matrix: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix to understand the classification performance and identify areas for improvement.
Cross-Validation: Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.
Real-Time Gesture Recognition:

Video Capture: Implement real-time video capture using OpenCV.
Gesture Detection: Continuously process video frames to detect and classify hand gestures in real-time.
Feedback: Display the detected gestures and corresponding actions on the screen.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for gesture recognition. By leveraging the power of Mediapipe for feature extraction and various machine learning classifiers for training, the system achieves high accuracy in recognizing user-defined hand gestures. The real-time gesture recognition system offers an intuitive way for users to interact with digital devices, opening up possibilities for applications in gaming, virtual reality, sign language interpretation, and human-computer interaction.
